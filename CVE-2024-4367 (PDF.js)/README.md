## Proof of concept

Open `poc_generalized.pdf` in Firefox, an Thunderbird, or (an app which uses) PDF.js.
If you see an alert, your installation is vulnerable.

For special scenarios (e.g. headless or Electron), you can take `poc_plaintext.pdf` and tweak the payload accordingly, with any text editor.
