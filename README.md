This repository hosts Proof-of-Concept (PoC) files relating to vulnerabilities found and reported on by Codean Labs.
These files are meant to demonstrate the issue(s) at hand and (sometimes) to show the impact of a possible exploit.

Additionally, these PoCs may also help you in verifying whether your system/app/machine is vulnerable or already patched.
Detailed information can be found in the blog posts linked in each sub-folder.
